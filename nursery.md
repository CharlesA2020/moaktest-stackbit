In this secure and intimate environment, the children learn about themselves and their world. Their days are filled with artistic and practical work , imaginative play and fairy tales, puppetry and music, circle games and healthy outdoor play.

Teachers try to ensure that actions seen by the child are permeated with logic and purpose. In this way, rather than by words, the child's whole being is imbued with order and harmony, developing in him or her a sense of security.

Co-ordination and well-developed senses are essential for intellectual development. Children of this age wish to test their senses, particularly the sense of balance and movement. They love to be on a see-saw, a narrow ledge or up a tree. Wooden toys have been especially designed to enhance a natural sense for form and touch.
