Waldorf High School tuition covers all the requirements of the SA Schools syllabus, but also offers a richer depth of learning. Regular tests and reports form part of the continuous assessment of the progress of each pupil.

Our goal is to develop each pupil's faculties of social, artistic, critical and creative abilities as much as the academic. Such a person, we believe, will be more widely prepared for life and for a contribution to society.

What is done in the High School is a natural complement to the groundwork in the Nursery and Primary Schools. It represents the fruit of all the growth, nourishment and care fostered on the younger child. Waldorf Education is conceived of as a whole, as an organic process. The child's living imagination, so carefully nurtured in the Primary School, grows organically into the realm of conceptual thought.

Themes that are handled in the Primary Main Lessons are recapitulated more consciously in the High School where the development of judgement and the challenges and changes of puberty and adolescence can be met with all the richness of the Waldorf approach.
